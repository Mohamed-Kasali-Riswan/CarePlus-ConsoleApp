CarePlus â€“ Patient Management System

CarePlus is a Java console-based application designed to help clinics efficiently manage doctors, patients, and appointments. It supports two roles: Admins can add doctors, manage schedules, and handle receptionists, while Receptionists can register patients and book appointments. The system uses file handling to persist data and ensures no appointment overlaps for doctors. Ideal for learning Java OOP, file I/O, and basic scheduling logic.
